# Dev thoughts
A collection of bite-sized functions, patterns, and techniques I've found useful for various development tasks.  You might find them useful too.

## Usage
These are not ready to use modules.  They are meant to spark ideas and serve as a starting point for solutions to common development tasks.  Use them accordingly.

Items are organized by focus area (e.g. ui, Postgres, etc.).

Enjoy.
